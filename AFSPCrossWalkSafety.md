# 🌟 AFSP Out of the Darkness Walk – Crosswalk Guard Training Guide

## 1. Purpose
Crosswalk Guards help keep walkers safe as they cross streets during the Out of the Darkness Walk. You are the first line of safety and hospitality for our participants.

---

## 2. Safety First
- **Your safety and the walkers’ safety are the top priority.**
- If there is an **emergency** (accident, medical issue, unruly driver, etc.), **call 911 immediately**.
- If you feel unsafe or overwhelmed, step back and alert an event coordinator.

---

## 3. Your Position
- **Stand on the sidewalk** on the side **walkers are coming from**.
- Make yourself visible — wear your safety vest if provided.
- Always face oncoming walkers and the crosswalk.

---

## 4. How to Manage Walkers

### 1. Before Crossing
- Stand on the sidewalk at the edge of the crosswalk.
- **Hold your hand out, palm facing the walkers (stop motion)** and say firmly but kindly:  
  > “Please remain on the sidewalk.”

### 2. Entering the Crosswalk
- Step into the crosswalk first.
- **Hold your hand out, palm facing cars (stop motion)** to signal traffic to stop.
- Make eye contact with drivers if possible.

### 3. When Safe
- Once you are in the center of the crosswalk and traffic has stopped, **turn to the walkers** and say:  
  > “It’s safe to cross now.”
- **Wave them forward** with an open hand motion.

### 4. During Heavy Traffic or Gaps
- If there is a break in walkers or heavy car traffic, **hold your hand out (stop motion)** toward the walkers and say:  
  > “Please wait here.”
- Allow cars to pass until it’s safe to restart crossing.

### 5. After the Last Walker
- Once no walkers are on the crosswalk, **step back to the sidewalk** with the walkers.
- **Wave cars on** to continue traffic flow.

---

## 5. Communication Style
- Be **stern and clear**: safety instructions must be understood.
- Be **courteous and kind**: remember this is a healing, community event.
- Use short, clear phrases (“Stop here,” “Safe to cross,” “Please wait”).

---

## 6. Handling Trash Collection
- There will be **trash bags at each crosswalk station**.
- If two volunteers are assigned to one crosswalk:
  - The volunteer **not currently directing traffic** should **hold the trash bag** to collect garbage (like empty water bottles) from walkers as they pass.
- Keep your area tidy but don’t compromise safety to pick up trash during heavy crossing.

---

## 7. Quick Reminders
- **Stay visible** (vest, hand signals, clear voice).
- **Always look both ways** before entering the crosswalk.
- **Keep your phone handy** for emergencies but don’t get distracted.
- **Check in with your partner volunteer** so you both know who is directing and who is collecting trash.

---

## 8. Emergency Protocol
- **Call 911** for emergencies.
- Then notify the nearest event coordinator.
- Keep calm and reassure walkers.

---

## 9. Spirit of the Event
This is a mental health and suicide prevention walk. Many participants are grieving or honoring loved ones.  
Your kindness and patience make a difference.  
Smile when possible, thank walkers, and show you care while maintaining safety.
