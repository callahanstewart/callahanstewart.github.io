# AFSP Out of the Darkness Walk - Fargo
# Crosswalk Guard Training Guide

## 1. Purpose
Crosswalk Guards help keep walkers safe as they cross streets during the walk.
It is your job to facilitate traffic and assist event participants with safely crossing the road.

---

## 2. Safety First
- **Your safety and the walkers’ safety are the top priority.**
- If there is an **emergency** (accident, medical issue, etc.), **call 911 immediately**.
- After calling 911, please notify an event coordinator. You can call/text Callahan Stewart at (218) 684-5936
- If you are feeling overwhelmed, tired, or unsure please swap responsibilities with the volunteer you are working with.

---

## 3. Your Position
- **Stand on the sidewalk** on the side **walkers are coming from**.
- Make yourself visible — wear your safety vest.
- Always face oncoming walkers when standing on the sidewalk, and face towards the intersection while walkers cross.

---

## 4. How to Manage Walkers

### 1. Before Crossing
- Stand on the sidewalk at the edge of the crosswalk.
- **Hold your hand out, palm facing the walkers (stop motion)** and say firmly:  
  > “Please remain on the sidewalk.”

### 2. Entering the Crosswalk
- Step into the crosswalk first.
- **Hold your hand out, palm facing cars (stop motion)** to signal traffic to stop.
- Make eye contact with drivers if possible.

### 3. When Safe
- Once you are in the center of the crosswalk and traffic has stopped, **turn to the walkers** and say:  
  > “It’s safe to cross.” or "Please cross now"
- **Wave them forward** with an open hand motion using your other hand.

### 4. During Heavy Traffic or Gaps
- If there is a break in walkers or heavy car traffic, **hold your hand out (stop motion)** toward the walkers and say:  
  > “Please wait at the sidewalk.” or "Stop here"
- Once no walkers are on the crosswalk, **step back to the sidewalk**.
- **Wave cars on** to continue traffic flow.

---

## 5. Communication Style
- Be **clear**: safety instructions must be understood.
- Be **Commanding**: walkers and traffic must be aware of all directions.
- Be **courteous**: remember this is a healing, community event.
- You will be given a whistle, you don't have to use this if you don't want to.
  - You can use this to alert traffic to stop/go, and to alert walkers to stop/go.
  - Please be aware of walkers when you use this, keep the whistles to short bursts instead of long whistles.

---

## 6. Handling Trash Collection
- There will be **trash bags at each crosswalk station**.
- The volunteer **not currently directing traffic** should **hold the trash bag** to collect garbage (like empty water bottles) from walkers as they pass.
- Keep your area tidy but don’t compromise safety to pick up trash during heavy crossing.

---

## 7. Quick Reminders
- **Stay visible** (vest, hand signals, clear voice).
- **Always look both ways** before entering the crosswalk.
- **Keep your phone handy** for emergencies but don’t get distracted.
- **Check in with your partner volunteer** so you both know who is directing and who is collecting trash.

## 8. Spirit of the Event
This is a suicide prevention event. Many participants are grieving or honoring loved ones.  
Your kindness and patience make a difference.  
Smile when possible, thank walkers, and show you care while maintaining safety.
